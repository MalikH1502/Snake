# Snake
## Project Overview
---

### How to play?
In snake, the objective is to collect as many apples as possible while avoiding eating your own character. The goal is to obtain a score higher than your previous attempt.

### How can I run this on my computer?
As of right now, I have not compiled it into an application so it is limited to be ran in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) given you have the Java addons and the latest Java SDK.
